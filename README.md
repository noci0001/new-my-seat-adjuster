# Vehicle App Template

This is a repository to get you started with Velocitas App development. It contains a very basic setup which will walk you through assisted project creation.

## Required software

* Visual Studio Code
* A container runtime supported by Visual Studio Code's devContainer feature. See [here](https://eclipse.dev/velocitas/docs/tutorials/quickstart/container_runtime/)

## Setup steps

1. Clone the repository and open it in Visual Studio Code **or** use Github Codespaces
3. Follow the steps through the assisted project creation
4. When prompted, rebuild the devContainer (:warning:under the hood, we have updated your container configuration:warning:) - if not prompted, manually rebuild the container using `View` -> `Command Palette...` -> `Dev Containers: Rebuild Container`
5. Start hacking!
